[{"content":"The \u0026ldquo;Hues of Intelligence\u0026rdquo; project is an art installation that challenges us to examine the influx of machines into our daily lives–to explore how their perspectives on the world compare to our own. Algorithms were tasked with sequencing a collection of colors; the results of their attempts are presented as a collection of prints and animations.\nIf machines will be making an ever-increasing proportion of our human decisions, then should we not ask ourselves what differences exist between our human perceptions and those of the decision-makers?\nThe \u0026ldquo;Hues of Intelligence\u0026rdquo; series speaks to the vast technological revolution going on all around us and the implications of machines playing the role of decision-makers in our world.\nA collection of machines are presented with the red, green, and blue intensities, which represent a collection of colors that mirror the function of cones in the human eye. It is asked to sort the colors in a way that preserves the relationships between them. Like colors should stay together, but the arrangement is allowed to be discovered by the machine.\nSince nature has a preference for ordering color, in essence, Hues of Intelligence seeks to answer the question: \u0026ldquo;Can a machine discover the rainbow?\u0026rdquo;\nA collection of attempts to perform this task is presented juxtaposed to a color wheel arranged by hue. The attempts are chosen from four algorithms: one demonstrates a machine learning to approximate the transformation to hue from labeled examples (supervised training), and the others were allowed to discover this concept instead (unsupervised). These three algorithms were not exposed to the true hue values; they were told only to keep similar colors close together.\nThe audience is invited to interrogate the prints at close range and build a visual intuition for the reasoning of the machines. Can they identify the natural ordering amongst the sea of algorithmic imagery?\nIf machines struggle to discover human preference, then should we entrust them with more substantive decisions? Is their ability to learn to approximate our preferences a sufficient criteria for handing over control?\nMore images in the gallery and alongside project details in the docs.\n","permalink":"http://hues.mpilosov.com/about/","summary":"The Hues of Intelligence project is an art installation that challenges us to examine the influx of machines into our daily lives–to explore how their perspectives on the world compare to our own.

The machine is presented with batches of colors and ask to sort them, evaluating its performance and updating its knowledge each time. Once enough batches are presented so that all 949 colors have been seen exactly once, the training process has completed its first \u0026ldquo;epoch,\u0026rdquo; and we capture the state of its learning process as an image. We repeat this process several hundred times\u0026ndash;allowing the models to see all of the colors repeatedly\u0026ndash;and arrange the images after each epoch into an animation.\nBelow, you can watch the evolution of the learning process under different circumstances.\n(make sure to select 4K resolution by selecting Settings -\u0026gt; Quality -\u0026gt; 2160p/4K)\nLearned In this \u0026ldquo;Learned\u0026rdquo; animation, the hues associated with each color are presented as the \u0026ldquo;correct answers,\u0026rdquo; which allows the model to learn (or mememorize) an arrangement which is quite similar to hue.

The second is called unsupervised learning, and involves defining an objective that can be computed without the need for \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; answers.\nIn this work, a neural-network architecture was designed so that it could learn the concept of hue with supervision. Then, the correct values of hue were hidden from the algorithm\u0026rsquo;s training process, and it was told only to keep similar colors close together. These represent the unsupervised attempts.\nTo establish a baseline for comparison, the same distance-preservation objective was given to a statistical optimization approach.\nVisualizations of Learning Attempts Here you can develop some intuition for the machine\u0026rsquo;s learning process by watching it evolve over time, in the form of a high-resolution animation.\nBelow are examples of images created at the end of 2160 training epochs.
